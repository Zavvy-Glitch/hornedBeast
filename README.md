# Horned Beast

## Lab 01

### In collaboration with: Kyle Cohen / TA - Chance Harmon

- This application was created to practice ES6 Arrow Functions and React Application building. The intention of the application is to allow a user to filter a varying number of 'Beasts' by the number of associated horns. Also to incorporate several other varying features to allow users to favorite a beast, display it as a modal, etc. The details below are for my own benefit to time how quickly and efficiently I am able to complete each task.
